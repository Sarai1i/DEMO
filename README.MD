## 🔍 Project Overview
This project aims to **enhance OCR (Optical Character Recognition) accuracy for Arabic text** by implementing a **fine-tuning and training pipeline** and providing an **Administrator Report Interface** for performance monitoring. The system enables **OCR improvement through large-scale dataset training**, tracks extracted text statistics, and ensures **transparent reporting with bad word detection and data analysis tools**.

## 🚀 Features

### 📌 1. OCR Training & Fine-Tuning
✅ Fine-tunes the OCR model using **a diverse Arabic dataset** with printed, handwritten, and mixed-style documents.  
✅ Reduces **Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER)** by at least **10%**.  
✅ Logs training progress, model accuracy improvements, and loss reduction trends.  
✅ Ensures **version control**, preserving previous models for rollback.  
✅ Provides **before-and-after performance comparison reports**.  

### 📌 2. Administrator Report Interface
✅ Displays **real-time OCR performance metrics** (processed documents, accuracy trends, confidence levels).  
✅ Supports **filtering** by **date range, document type, confidence thresholds**.  
✅ Enables **report downloads in PDF and CSV formats**.  
✅ Includes **bad word detection** to flag inappropriate content and prevent flagged reports from being downloaded.  
✅ Supports **pagination for large datasets** and maintains logs for **at least six months**.  
✅ Sends **notifications** upon report generation or flagged content.
